# Journal repository

Please use this repository to add your journal entries. They are visible to the entire class, but are private otherwise. Since GitHub does not have spell or grammar checking, you will need to write and edit your text before copy-pasting into this repository. After you have done that, then you can add images and  format your text.

To learn to be a wizard at formatting your text for maximum readability, check out the [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) guide at [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

# Rubric for weekly journal entries

**Assignments are due before class on the day of class.** Anything submitted after this is late.

Each week will include one or more readings of a topical nature. Students are expected to compose a short journal entry on that topic. This is in your own voice and should reflect what you learned.

- There are 10 weekly journals.
- Each is worth 5 points.
- You can miss 1 and still get full credit.

Each weekly journal entry is assessed as follows:

Did you include key learning points from the reading? (1 point)

Did you include references to original work(s) to include page number (where appropriate)? (1 point)

Did you provide at least one example (your own) from actual practice that illustrates one or more of your key learning points? Please try to find an example from design whether physical, digital, interactional, publication, etc. (1 point)

Did your example(s) clearly illustrate point(s) intended? In most cases, you will need to include an image or something that helps the reader understand your point. (1 point)

Did you communicate with impact? (1 point)

How you might lose points:

- For each day an assignment is late, you will lose 1 point.
- You can lose a point if your entry contains excessive typographical or grammatical errors; think of this is as 'not communicating with impact'.

These assignments are for your benefit: they should help cement learning points in your memory and to tie them to practical examples that you will recall later. Hopefully, you will find this process useful so that you get into the habit of demonstrating your ability to analyze designs as well as communicate your findings with impact.

You should be able to achieve full points on every assignment if you follow the rubric above. I'm not looking for detailed knowledge, but evidence that you understand the material and can relate it to actual examples in practice.
