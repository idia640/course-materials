# Guidelines for Case Study

30 points.

Think of your case study as a narrative. Design it as a "poster" with one to two pages that could contain multiple panels. You do not need to make a poster; plan to display electronically. Your format should be a professional quality publication design that you would feel comfortable presenting to a customer.

Be sure to communicate:

- The challenge problem (5 points)
- The target user population (5 points)
- Your design solution for nudging behavior and your desired outcome (5 points)
- Design decisions that link to scientific concepts explored in this class (5 points)
- How you might evaluate the effectiveness of your design (5 points)

Your final presentation should be about 10-15 minutes long and is a chance to show off your thinking. Aside from presenting the above, please include:

- The most useful concept(s) or interesting idea(s) you drew from the class (5 points)
